Investors take huge risk in making investments because they lack the
information about the future prospects of the company or we can also say that
they lack forecasting. Due to which they may have to face loss in future. Similar
is the case with transportation, especially when it comes to airline mode
because of huge increase in investment and risk factor. Thus, this project
proposes a system using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based Recurrent
Neural Networks for forecasting the number of airline passengers. Unlike the
existing schemes, the proposed scheme is capable enough to minimize the
Root Mean Square Error to maximum extent which ultimately would lead to
better forecasting results. The proposed scheme consist of four steps: (i) LSTM
model construction, (ii) data processing and making data suitable for LSTM
model, (iii) fitting a stateful LSTM network model to the training data and (iv)
evaluation of the static LSTM model on the test data and report the
performance of forecast. Furthermore, the obtained results indicate that the
proposed scheme reduces the chances of false positive to great extent and is
practical enough to be implemented in real-time scenario.
